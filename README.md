Dark Processing Theme (for 3.0)
===================

A dark theme for the Processing IDE (a little easier on the eyes!) for Processing 3.0.

For a Processing 2.0 theme, see [this repository](https://github.com/jeffThompson/DarkProcessingTheme_2.0), for P5 1.5, see [this repo](https://github.com/jeffThompson/DarkProcessingTheme).

####INSTALLATION
**PREFERENCES.TXT**  
Replace your `preferences.txt` with mine.

**LIB FOLDER**  
Look in `~/Applications/Processing.app/Contents/Java/lib`.
Replace the the entire folder (making a copy of the original in case you hate my changes!). This contains lots of changes, including all the button files.

(Windows install? Not sure! Please let me know if you figure it out!)
